# Three.js trial

Workout with [three.js](git://github.com/mrdoob/three.js.git).
I propose to create pictures like ["Disgaia Series"](http://disgaea.jp/index.html) with this repository.

## install

Enter command listing below after cloned the repository.
If you don't have Node and npm, you need to go [here](http://nodejs.org/) and install them.

    # if you already have "bower", next command is unneccessary.
    npm install -g bower
    
    # install dependencies with "bower"
    bower install

Then open `index.html`!!
